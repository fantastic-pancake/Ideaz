## Cards Against Humanities ( A game for horrible people ) 
### Make a room, or join a room and play a round of the classic Cards Against Humanities.
* Cards against humanities resource api is available online, so we have all the sets and expansions we need.
* Allow users to play CAH with each other online
* Websockets provide real time chatting for the lolz and discussing funny card combinations
* Create game rooms or join existing rooms
* OAuth facebook

### Challenges
* One player is the card tzar, and picks a card containing an incomplete sentence. Other players must choose the a card from their hand that they think would complete the sentence and make the card tzar laugh. Game logic would be the main beast. Would need to listen for certain events happening. Would be a fun challenge that seems very reasonable for three weeks.

## Fitness App ( Paul's idea from way back ) || "Leg Day"
### Allows users to record, track, and manage those gainz.
* OAuth facebook / etc...
* User dashboard
* Third party API for workout info maybe
* Create custom routine
* Track personal growth

### Challenges
* Probably creating custom routines. Allowing users to add pictures if they want. Also maybe a cool feature to have a private section of the dashboard that facilitates a "before" and "after" image upload.

## Real Time API Updates + Music = Weird music box
### A little out there, but might be a cool one to explore or borrow from
* Users search from a series of third party API that support real time updates
* Users see a visual ping on the webpage every time an update happens, accompanied by a musical note.
* Users can save their favorite API's to their account
* OAuth

## Recipe Playlist
### Allows users to record recipes and match each one with a playlist / augment their online recipes with videos/media/etc
* OAuth
* User dashboard
* Users can record their recipes and inject various pieces of media in for personal usage.
* Spotify/Youtube/Tumblr/Instagram/Imgur/Pinterest API
* Users can post their recipes to a community dashboard
* more feature creep ( upvote recipe, comments, etc.. )

## Youtube Binge ( Node.js/Websocket deep dive )

* Main feature: synchronized playlist, synchronized video playback - no matter how many users are connected - using websockets

## Other to consider
### Watson API, NASA API, AI Chatbots, Amazon SC2 Servers, CSS Animations/Parallax,
